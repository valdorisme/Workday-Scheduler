# Workday-Scheduler
The purpose of this webpage is to create a responsive daily planner with typical business hours (9a-5p)
Upon opening page, current date should be at the top of the page
As the user scrolls down, the time will be displayed to the left of the page
The time rows will be color-coded to indicate the current time, past time, and future time
In these time slots, the user will be able to type activities planned for that time period
Towards the right of the page, at the end of each time column, will be a "Save" button to allow the user to save the input
